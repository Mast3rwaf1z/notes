*   Security requirements

    Confidentiality: only the receiver and sender can read data
    
    Privacy: no personal info
    
    Integrity: data is not modified

    Availability: servies is available when needed?

*   Security attacks


    Interruption: stops a service i think

    Interception, Modification, Fabrication

    *   Attacks
    
    passive: difficult to detect - Security analysis
    *   Security analysis

        IDS: Intrusion detection (service/system)
        *   real time (online) or not real time (offline) 

        IPS: Intrusion prevention (service/system)

    active: easy to detect, probably what we've heard before

*   Estimating likelihood

*   Estimating impact

    Technical:

    Business:

    impact and likelihood combined can be viewed in a table showing severity

*   Basic cryptographic methods

    Terminology:

    Plaintext, Ciphertext(coded message), Cipher (method to decipher), 

    *   Encryption
        *   three dimensions

            type of cipher

            substitution, transposition

*   Feistel Cipher structure

    Conventional block encryption algorithms
