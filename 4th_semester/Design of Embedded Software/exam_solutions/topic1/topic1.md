# solutions for topic 1:
## what is an interrupt?
in general there are two types of interrupts, there are hardware interrupts and software interrupts, in terms of hardware interrupts you would define an interrupt pin on the GPIO of the system, when a signal is sent to this pin, an interrupt to the said task is generated. In terms of software interrupts you can define a function that intentionally sends a signal to the specified interrupt pin.
## how is interrupt installed?
first you define the pin on which you want to interrupt, then you can define the function to call, in the default C++ fashion :)
## How are interrupts generated?
an interrupt is generated by sending a signal to a pin defined as an interrupt pin, hereafter the isr is called
## How are this different to isr03.ino
It is more low level, it changes registers to enable interrupt
