# Lecture 4: Analytical Modelling of Parallel Systems and Applications
*   My first thought is that there are different stages of a parallel algorithm that could be split into seperate modules
    *   Minimizing overhead?

*   we can reach superlinear speedup
    *   DFS
        *   Not always
*   Scalability
    *   parallelising an algorithm only makes sense with large problems
