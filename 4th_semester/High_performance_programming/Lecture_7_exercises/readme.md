# lecture 7 exercises
These scripts are using sys.argv variable such that the script is made to be run with by: `python sequential_random_set.py 10000 100` to create a CSV with 10.000 elements and put them into 100 sets, all the other programs work the same way. I have edited them with try/except statements to avoid this exception but i prefer that it's run as i've mentioned.

as i've mentioned in my mail, the only explaination i have for why the parallel time and jit time is slower than sequential time is because i'm executing simple instructions.
