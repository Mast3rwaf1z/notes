# VejledermÃ¸de 4
## Pre:
*   Problem analysis
    *   Setting up time constraints
    *   GEO vs. LEO-satellite orbits/processing time
        *   Transmission delay
        *   Propagation delay
        *   Processing delay
    *   Real time = 100 ms latency per data packet
        *   what is maximum data rate
        *   how long will it take to send an image?
        *   compression of image in case downlink capacity is exceeded
    *   GEO > 100 ms
    *   LEO <= 100 ms
    *   Constallation
        *   Walker star
        *   Walker delta
        *   Mixed geometry
    *   Satellite communication
        *   Issues with interlink
