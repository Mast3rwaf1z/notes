# VejledermÃ¸de 4
## Pre:
*   Problem analysis
    *   Setting up time constraints
    *   GEO vs. LEO-satellite orbits/processing time
        *   Transmission delay
        *   Propagation delay
        *   Processing delay
    *   Real time = 100 ms latency per data packet
        *   what is maximum data rate
        *   how long will it take to send an image?
        *   compression of image in case downlink capacity is exceeded
    *   GEO > 100 ms
    *   LEO <= 100 ms
    *   Constallation
        *   Walker star
        *   Walker delta
        *   Mixed geometry
    *   Satellite communication
        *   Issues with interlink
    *   How useful are satellites
    
*   Disasters
    *   Floods: 3/5
    *   Volcano: 2.25/5
    *   Oil spill: 4/5
    *   Forest fire: 5/5
    *   Tsunami: 2/5
    *   Storms: 2/5

*   Forest fires
    *   Pre:
        *   monitoring humidity
        *   monitoring droughts
    *   During:
        *   spreading
    *   Post:
        *   is the fire still not spreading
    
    *   maybe make some severity index and base the stage of the disaster based on this

## Meeting
*   don't pick multiple disasters to work with
*   argumentation is fine, but we don't get any points from implementing multiple
*   make requirements based on the product
*
