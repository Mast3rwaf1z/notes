# Tidsplan.
* work on the design chapter such that the idea is clear before implementation
  * important to determine how long it will take to implement
## Task allocation & expectations.
* how successfull will we expect the project to be?
  * israel expects a proof of concept
* we're not really considering edge computing
  * compressing and detection on the satellite is edge computing
  * defining our system as edge computing is not really important
* we should determine how to test the system (starting a fire is not a good idea)
  * top down fire pictures is hard  to find
  * 
# Fire detcetion algorithms. (moh)
* go for some simple algorithms and try to get them to work with our project
* algorithm will not be simple to come up with
# Question about: General compression [comment from Anders] (ras)

# report
* requirements before design (as always)
* sequence diagram? like in HPP with distributing tasks?
* clearly defined functions of product in design
* figure 5.1 and section before design.
## implementation
* do we have any specifics on the implementation? (israel)
  * compression, taking a picture, libcamera, python
* will compression mess with the detection algorithm? (israel)
* if we do not detect a fire there is no reason to compress
