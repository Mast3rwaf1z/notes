Compression works differently for different spectrums
    we could have algorithms for different spectrums

we probably need to assess how many satellites we would need to solve our problem

make some use cases for this solution

we should keep focus on getting a problem we can work with later on rather than filling the report with stuff more relevant for earlier semesters
    i.e make the problem analysis condensed such that there is a lot of information but isn't neccisarily long

clearly define the problem before the problem analysis, not neccisarily an initial problem statement if the introduction is good enough to do this.

don't discuss the raspberry pi too much, just discuss the specific one we're gonna use and switch in like implementation if its absolutely neccesary for our usecase
    maybe mention that since all the newer models of raspberry pi's use the same architecture they should be able to run out of the box with the same software, aka we could swap the sd card between the initial pi and the new one.
