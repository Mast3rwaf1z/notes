-- Problem 1.1
-- maybe values are used, so i'd always use a do block
-- useless where
-- line 14 concatenates x to a recursion as the result of the function, x is of type a, while the function returns Maybe a, its a type error

-- Problem 1.2

-- Problem 2.2
-- d is parametric polymorphism
-- a b and c is ad hoc polymorphism
-- i think c can be seen as parametric polimorphism? a just has to be showable, you can declare your type to be showable...
