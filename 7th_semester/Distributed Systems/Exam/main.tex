\begin{frame}{\mainframe{Distributed Mutual Exclusion}}
    What is a mutex? Kinda a Lock for distributed systems \ldots

    In a distributed system a mutex is for locking a shared resource in a network, traditionally in a program, a lock would be enough to handle concurrent writes/reads, but when the communication is expensive, locking the resource is harder to do.
\end{frame}

% A mutual exclusion means that a shared resource between processes should be coordinated between processes in some way. For this there are multiple algorithms that can ensure a network can reach mutual exclusion. They have their advantages and disadvantages that i will discuss in this presentation

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{Mutex Algorithms}}
    \section{Mutex algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Centralized Algorithm
        \item Token Ring Algorithm
        \item Ricart and Agrawala's algorithm
        \item Maekawas algorithm
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% The centralized algorithm is an algorithm where a centralized server will handle whether a process can access the critical resource in a network.
% This is a very simple architecture, and its implementation is simple, but it also has a huge flaw that any failures at the centralized server will result in a full system failure. This is bad.

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{Centralized algortihm}}
    \begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
        \begin{figure}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/1-mutex.png}

    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
        \tiny{All three nodes highlighted are points of failure.}
    \end{minipage}
\end{frame}

% This is the token ring algorithm, the idea here is to remove the centralized server from the system, essentially making the system completely decentralized. Here the devices are communicating a token to each other which signifies that that process is allowed to access the critical section. One of the big advantages of this algorithm is how much each node can communicate with the critical section. once it has the token, it can communicate all it wants with the critical section until it transmits the token to the next device.
% The disadvantage of such a system is that if one node fails the whole system fails.

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{Token Ring Algorithm}}

    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
        \tiny{All nodes are points of failure at any given time.}
    \end{minipage}
\end{frame}

% The ricart and agrawala's algorithm is one where each of the nodes keeps track of whether a node is in the critical section at any time.
% This is useful as if multicast is efficient, then access is granted swiftly while any node wishing to enter doesn't have to communicate, it would know if anyone is accessing the critical section
% Once again the disadvantage is that one node failing means the whole system fails

% This algorithm is similar to ricart and agrawala, but instead of asking each node in the network, it only has to ask a small subset of the network.
% This can be

    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
        \tiny{Very similar to Ricart and Agrawala, but only nodes in the subset failing will result in a particular node to fail. If you're a bit smart about choosing the subsets this can be minimized.}

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{Performance}}
    Bandwidth means Entry and Exit potential. This means how many times an acces can happen per messages.\\
    Token ring is infinite because the node itself chooses when to send the token.\\
    Ricart and Agrawala's algorithm has a bandwidth of 1+n-1 if it can do multicast in hardware, otherwise its n-1+n-1, as it will now have to unicast to everyone.

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{IP Multicast - Hardware Support}}
    Uses a protocol called IGMP

    If there's hardware support, the sender transmits one message and the intermediary devices will determine how many devices it will transmit the message to.\\
    If there is not hardware support, then the sender will have to unicast many messages at once to its receivers instead.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\regularframe{IP Multicast - Problems}}
    Out of order delivery, this can happen due to changes in routing. Consider a network with a slow and a fast intermediary node as two independant routes, if the sender sends a message through the slow node to the reciver followed by a message through the fast node, then the receiver might receive the second message before the first.
\end{frame}

    Generally, causal ordering means that the events in a network does not depend on a future event, this is usually realized using lamport clocks.\\
