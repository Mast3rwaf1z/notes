apr 1: 1 hour in afternoon
Did exercise1 in exercises to orient myself in the program and gained a basic understanding of the code for this project

apr 11: 16:40 - 17:40
made a class SteppingEmulator implementing AsyncEmulator(this made the most sense as i wouldn't have to implement everything unrelated to this feature) and edited exercise_runner to use this class, added the first few class elements for this emulator to work as expected, removed solution to exercises

apr 12: 15:55 - 16:20
changed class from input statements to pynput, might wanna add a prompt to install this software? added a little description at init
