# Lecture 7 notes
$X(j\Omega)$ is the fourier transform if $\sigma$ is zero

$\omega = \Omega T = 2\pi f \frac{1}{f_s}$

Discrete frequency: $\omega$

Continuous frequency: $\Omega$

sample frequency: $f_s$

if $f$ is equal to $f_s$ then $\omega$ is equal to $2\pi$

### Recap of analog filters
A brick wall filter transitions instantly once it reaches the cutoff frequency $\Omega_c$

Butterworth filters is an implementation of this, they're not perfect but they approximate a brick wall filter

## Exercise
0 db at DC

3 db cut-off frequency at 1 kHz

Amplification at 750 Hz minimum -1.0 dB

Amplification at 1500 Hz minimum -10.0 dB

Sample frequency: 8 kHz
