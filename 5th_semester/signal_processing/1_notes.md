# Lecture 1 notes
## sampling
*  time between samples: T\_s
   *  this is constant for one sample
*  when using a sample we use the notation of x[n] rather than x[t] because we are using the sample values set instead of continuous time t
## complex numbers
*  bit confused about why the theta in polar form of 1+j is pi/4 + 2kÏ€
## signals
*  a signal is a sinusoid function
## impulse response
*  the signal a system receiving a signal will respond with once receiving the initial signal
   *  we know everything about the input based on the response
