apr 1: 1 hour in afternoon
Did exercise1 in exercises to orient myself in the program and gained a basic understanding of the code for this project

apr 11: 16:40 - 17:40
made a class SteppingEmulator implementing AsyncEmulator(this made the most sense as i wouldn't have to implement everything unrelated to this feature) and edited exercise_runner to use this class, added the first few class elements for this emulator to work as expected, removed solution to exercises

apr 12: 15:55 - 16:20
changed class from input statement to pynput, might wanna add a prompt to install this software? added a little description at init

apr 16: 15:50 - 17:35
cleaned the code a bit for the stepping emulator
started working on GUI, made a wrapper for exercise runner and added some circles to show devices

apr 20: 17:00 - 19:00
created task 2 branch and continued working on gui

apr 21: 22:30 - 23:30
looked into weird placement of elements on linux and fixed it (a little badly but it works

apr 26: 16:40 - 17:40
moved some stuff into exercise runner to be executed in main thread while the main function of the program is run in a seperate thread, this is because tkinter will not work unless it is running in the main thread

apr 27: 17:00 - 18:00
more data visualisation

apr 28: 18:50 - 19:50
moved the creation of device visualisation out from main to easier create these devices, this will also allow for more configurability

apr 29: 18:40 - 20:20
table and data formatting

may 1: 00:00 - 02:30
drew some diagrams as a plan to how i want to place the individual device visualisation in the window

may 1: 18:10 - 19:10
fixed the placement of the devices, they are placed precisely how they should be now

may 1: 23:00 - 00:00
added the last few tables and alligned the contents in the devices

may 2: 19:00 - 20:00
merged branch 22 and main, added new stuff from gui to stepper and tested with another exercise

may 9: 18:50 - 19:50
read some document sent by supervisor
fixed issue where keyboard listeners was never killed
added lines to the visualisation

may 9: 23:30 - 00:30
added lines to canvas for sending messages, might also add one for receiving and color code them with a prompt in the top left corner about what the colors mean

may 11: 23:30 - 01:30
fixed issues with too much content in messages and i'm pretty much satisfied with the gui as it is now

may 12: 23:30 - 01:30
added controls page to gui, tested some optimization for windows but failed, added received lines and is satisfied with the overall gui more now. created pull request, probably gonna work on readme next

may 19: 23:30 - 01:00
show and pick command initial work

may 21: 12:20 - 13:50
started looking into implementing the syncemulator into stepper and worked more on the pick command
