Find the range for each of the following random variables.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I toss a coin 100 times. Let X be the number of heads i observe.
	
		I observe that there can be 0 of the coins that are heads, while also all coins being heads and any permutation inbetween, so the result would be:

		$R_X=\{0,1,2,3, \ldots, 100\}$
	
		\item I toss a coin until the first heads appears. Let Y be the total number of coin tosses.

		$R_Y=\{1,2,3,4,\ldots, \infty\}$

		\item The random variable T is defined as the time (in hours) from now until the next earthquake occurs in a certain city.

		$R_T=\{0,1,2,3, \ldots, \infty\}$
	\end{enumerate}
