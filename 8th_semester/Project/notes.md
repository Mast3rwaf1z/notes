# Solution type
* we want a proactive solution
	* a reactive solution will be too late, and a reactive solution is more of a mitigative solution rather than preventative solution.
* when is it too late?
* how do you measure stress levels before a person would feel "stressed"
* stress seems to often happen in the context of a conflict in a given situation
* fear of failure

## Acute Stress
* can't be proactive

## Chronic Stress
* Heath issues
	* The easier solution to this type is to visit your doctor...
	* disabilities
	    * less stressed in some situations...

## Episodic Stress
* Exams
* Past negative experiences
	* Reexams
* Analyse patterns in behaviour

* Could shift focus to general heathcare monitoring/prevention



# possible solutions



# we got some options for containerization for testing of this project
containerization options:
    docker
        advantages:
            well supported, partial experience of the group
        disadvantages:
            not a real isolated environment
            android might be a pain to test
    kubernetes
        ??? i barely know what it is

    NixOS VM tools
        advantages:
            instead of a container, the system is built as a virtual machine, this could be useful to fully control the entire environment
            completely automatic testing

        disadvantages
            horrible documentation
