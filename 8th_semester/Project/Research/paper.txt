Abstract:
    should describe the project, NOT THE PAPER

Introduction:
    1 - 2 pages MAX
    have an image on the first page, says a lot more words than the same in text
    structure the introduction chronologically, assess the big picture, introduce the problem, mention what we did, then results and what we're contributing to the world
    Contributing SHOULD NOT be more research topics, at least if it is then make it sound different!

Related work:
    should take the sources and somehow group prior work into themes, in a longer (10 page) paper, these themes could be subsections

Design:
    Should assess the goals of our product, how it should work, the process we went through designing it (NOT IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICS) 
    Figures tables and diagrams should be placed inline as they are introduced in the text, this gives a better flow in reading
    Implementation details at the end in a subsection if it has to be there, papers are better without this section though. Should not be a simple write-up, but focus on innovation and realisation of ideas.
    
Method:
    Since our project is more of an engineering oriented paper, we shouldn't assess the validity, but rather analyse our product in this section.
    We would probably still use a Quantitative laboratory experiments outline for our project, we'd like the most controlled environment for testing

Results:
    Most important part of this section is that it doesn't assess the correctness, quality, or conclusion based on the data, its just a detail description of how the results were gathered.
    Tell a story with the data
    
Discussion:
    An extension of the results section, this section should show how good the results are, why they're bad, why we were too late, why this thing that we did changed everything
    Focus on what is interesting, no bloat
    Be honest

Future work:
    what did we do that warrants more work? We should avoid making a list of small things to fix and instead focus on the big picture, what kind of project could fix the problems we had?
    make it inspiring

Conclusion:
    Answer the claims we make in the introduction
    summarize
    do not re-report, can mention things, but re-reporting is done earlier
    Write the conclusion such that a random guy from a press could read the paper and write a correct article about it
