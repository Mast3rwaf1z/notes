what is interesting to look at:
    how are we gonna measure it
    how can we alert them before its too late
    maybe you don't even need sensor data for episodic stress
        calendar
        journaling / diary
            ask questions?
            track mood?
                a fuckton of machine learning solutions.... :sadge:
                find some research on that

        sensor data is also very hard to draw a stress related conclusion about
    
    ask the user daily questions and analyze this


analysis points
    high heart rate in context of exercise or something...

paper setup
    sander has a paper about writing papers that could be interesting
