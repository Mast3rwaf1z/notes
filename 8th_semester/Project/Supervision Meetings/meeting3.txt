in a paper you'd maybe not have a defined problem statement

research question at the end of introduction?

or a hypothesis?
    maybe not the best option for us, we don't know the outcome of our system by the design.

not neccessarily describe all the related works
    consider like what we could say in 1 sentence about multiple sources, both to cook down the related work and to show that we've explored what's out there.
    
    kinda use the sources as citations instead of describing them in detail.

about the "smart garment" wearable solution, we haven't considered it that much, so we could drop it
    using an app, on a smartphone or a smart watch could be a better project
    especially because we don't have any special reason to choose to go that way...

journaling:
    journal at a set time, rather than at random
        mitigates any bias

        make a questionaire for the user rather than a raw journal?

        research if there's a scale of stress defined somewhere
            ask quantifiable questions

                how well did you sleep last night?
                    could be a good indicator of episodic stress

            how do we translate the scale to some intervention?

        we should consider soon what kind of intervention we want to do
            a message? advice?
                base this on some litterature

    if we go the journaling route, we should probably reconsider whether we want to use simulation.

maybe consider the wearable part as a future work part.
    consider something like advice first, then say we can redesign that form of intervention in future work
