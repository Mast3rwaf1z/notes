Problem Oriented Competences
Structural Competences
Interpersonal competences
Reflective Competences

What am i strong at:
* Problem solving
    why did i choose this? I have a tendency to focus on a problem until its solved, which works out most of the time...
* Distributed project management
    why did i choose this? I haven't done it a lot, but through stuff like git or project board and such, i've learned to work more with this type of project work.
* Knowledge Exchange
    why did i choose this? Once i know a topic i'm pretty good at teaching someone how to do it too, especially if its something like learning a language.


What am i improving at:
* Team Roles
    Why did i choose this? Its an important skill in management, and i've started using it more in projects, so it helps.
* Setting objectives
    Why did i choose this? Its something useful to aim your project at, i haven't done it a lot.
* Constructive feedback
    Why did i choose this? Same as the others...

What am i not good at:
* Problem analysis
    Why did i choose this? I'm very bad at finding an overall view of the project early on.
* Managing time- and activities
    why did i choose this? I'm bad at managing project time in general.

Practice view - where do i have most experience?
* nice way to structure the profile, but it doesn't explain how good i am in something...
    

Conceptual view - where do i have the strongest knowledge base?
* probably a more theoretical way to view competences

Performance view - what do i do best?
* it would focus on what i do well. Knowledge Exchange as an example I haven't practised it a lot but i can do it reasonably well once i get the topic myself. Confidence is key.

Preference view - What do i like the most?
* Its a lot like a CV, instead of viewing my competences based on everything i'm good at, its based on what i find interesting and not neccisarily is good at
    probably good to find a motivated person.

Development view - how do the list of competences match with who i want to be, professionally speaking
* It focuses more on what i find interesting, but probably also more in the context of what role i'd like to have in a project
    a good place to be as a student
    

profile structure:
    i think i want to focus on a development view, especially because i'm currently a student.
    make examples of how i've done the things i'm good at in my competences
